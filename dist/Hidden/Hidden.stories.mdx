# Hidden

The `<Hidden>` component is used to render its `children` as 
invisible text which can still be read out by accessibility 
tools such as screenreaders.

Integrated by default with the `<Error/>` component, the
`<Hidden>` component renders an invisible `'Error: '` 
string which will be picked up by assistive technologies.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Hidden">
    <div className='error'>
      <Hidden>Error: </Hidden> There has been a problem.
    </div>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable of={Hidden}/>
