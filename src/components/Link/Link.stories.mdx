# Link

A `<Link>` component renders its children inside an anchor tag with associated 
attributes and styling. By default, links will have a target of `_blank` - this 
default behaviour can be overridden by updating the `DEFAULT_TARGET` value in 
the component code.

<Canvas>
  <Story name='Basic'>
    <Link href='https://www.google.com'>Google</Link>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Link Behaviour

Links are most commonly passed a `href` prop, however they can also be passed 
an `onClick` prop to handle click events, as well as a `target` prop to 
override the default behaviour.

<Canvas>
  <Story name='With onClick'>
    <Link onClick={() => alert('Clicked!')}>With onClick</Link>
  </Story>
  <Story name='With target'>
    <Link href='https://www.google.com' target='_top'>Google</Link>
  </Story>
</Canvas>
