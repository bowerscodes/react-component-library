# Rating

The `<Rating/>` component is a row of Radio inputs which allows the user to rate 
something - by default, this will be out of 10, but can be overridden by passing 
a value to the `rateOutOf` prop.

<Canvas>
  <Story name='Default' >
    <Rating 
      fieldId='rating'
    />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

By default, the legend below the radios will identify the options as 'strongly 
disagree', 'undecided', and 'strongly agree' - these can be overridden by passing 
custom string values to the `lowerBoundText`, `medianText`, and `upperBoundText`.

To preserve screen space, the `medianText` value will only render if `rateOutOf` is
set to greater than 7, and the width of the screen is more than 500px. 

**Note:** for content designed for consumption on devices with a screen width of less 
than 420px, a `rateOutOf` value of no greater than `5` is recommended.

<Canvas>
  <Story name='Custom Labels & Lengths' >
    <Rating 
      fieldId='rating-out-of-10'
      rateOutOf={10}
      lowerBoundText='Poor'
      medianText='Unremarkable'
      upperBoundText='Excellent'
    />
    <Rating 
      fieldId='rating-out-of-5'
      rateOutOf={5}
      lowerBoundText='Hate it'  
      upperBoundText='Love it'
    />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## In a Group

The `<Group />` component can be used to group a `<Rating />` component in a 
`<fieldset>` tag with a label, and any associated validation errors.

<Canvas>
  <Story name='In a Group' >
    <Group 
      fieldId='rating-group'
      label='Overall, how satisfied are you with this product?'
      hint='Please score out of 10'
      error='Please select a score'
    >
      <Rating 
        fieldId='rating'
        rateOutOf={10}
        lowerBoundText='Very Dissatisfied'
        medianText='Neutral'  
        upperBoundText='Very Satisfied'
      />
    </Group>
  </Story>
</Canvas>
