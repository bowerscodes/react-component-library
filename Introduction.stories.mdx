  <h1>React Component Library</h1>
  <p>React Component Library is a collection of reusable components that can be 
  used in any React application.</p>
  <p>Each component has been designed with versatility in mind, and each one can 
  cater for a range of input attributes.</p>

  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  <p>To begin, select a component on the Sidebar to the left.</p>
  <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Users browsing on mobile devices with smaller screen 
  sizes may need to tap back on to the Canvas after selecting a component to view.</p>
